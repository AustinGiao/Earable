This is a project for acoustic authentication.
1. audio-only authentication
   Pretty good
2. audio-vibration transfer function authentication
   1) spectrogram-based 80% accuracy
   2) frequency response-based 70% accuracy
   3) Long-time frequency response-based 90+% However, the duration of authentication is too long.
   4) Coherence-based authentication, only match the similarity MobiCom'17: "Continuous Authentication for Voice Assistants"
